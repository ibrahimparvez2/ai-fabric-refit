🧵✨ UX Flow for Prompt Refinement
🔁 Step 1: User Uploads Photos (Fabric Dump)
They upload multiple images (used clothing, textures, colors).

These go to:

gs://your-bucket/uploads/{user_id}/image1.jpg etc.

Optionally tagged by AI or user

🔁 Step 2: Initial AI-Generated Prompt (Auto Mode)
You use Gemini Pro to generate a default fusion prompt like:

"Design a patchwork textile using navy blue cotton shirt, light-washed denim, and floral silk scarf. Fuse them into a single high-fashion item with high contrast."

🔁 Step 3: User Edits Prompt (Manual Mode)
If they’re not satisfied, give them a simple UI input like:

📝 “How should we blend your fabrics?”

They can type:

“More contrast, less symmetry”

“Focus on denim texture, make silk secondary”

“Grunge-meets-minimalism fusion”

You can append this to the original prompt programmatically:

refined_prompt = base_prompt + " Style notes: " + user_input

🔁 Step 4: Rerun Image Generation
Send the new refined prompt to Gemini Vision (or DALL·E) and regenerate the image.

🛠 Tips for Prompt Structuring
You can guide the user with prompt helpers like:

"What should be the dominant fabric?"

"What style are you going for?"

"Should the design be symmetrical, asymmetrical, chaotic, or clean?"

Then assemble their answers into:

Create a fashion concept using fabrics A, B, and C.
- Dominant fabric: Denim
- Style: Futuristic grunge
- Fusion: Asymmetrical layering
This keeps it structured, and Gemini can parse it beautifully.
